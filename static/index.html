    <h1>Welcome to Koosah.INFO</h1>
    <p>Pardon this somewhat bare-bones and utilitarian home page. A nicer one
    is in the works.</p>

    <h2>What’s Here?</h2>

    <h3><a href="mm_obs_demo_v2.html">Real-Time Upper Atmosphere Weather</a></h3>
    <p>This is a map detailing upper-atmosphere weather observations made by
    automated recording equipment aboard commercial aircraft in the
    Seattle area. It’s interactive; hover the mouse pointer over the colored
    dots that represent observations to see the details of that observation.

    <h3><a href="mm_obs_demo_v3.html">Mobile-Friendly Version of the Above</a></h3>
    <p>If you’re using a smartphone, iPad, or other mobile device, this is
    probably the version you want. Instead of hovering with a mouse pointer
    (which you probably don’t have), touch the dots. Because of screen-size
    limitations, it displays less information per observation than the former
    page.</p>
