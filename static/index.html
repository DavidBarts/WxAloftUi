    <h1>Welcome to Koosah.INFO</h1>
    <p>Pardon this somewhat bare-bones and utilitarian home page. A nicer one
    is in the works.</p>

    <h2>What’s Here?</h2>

    <h3><a href="mm_obs_demo_v2.html">Real-Time Upper Atmosphere Weather</a></h3>
    <p>This is a map detailing upper-atmosphere weather observations made by
    automated recording equipment aboard commercial aircraft in the
    Seattle area. It’s interactive; hover the mouse pointer over the colored
    dots that represent observations to see the details of that observation.

    <h3>Mobile Device Support</h3>
    <p>Alas, it is quite limited at this time. <em>Some</em> mobile devices work
    with the above page, and <em>some</em> work with
    <a href="mm_obs_demo_v3.html">this page</a> (touch the dots to bring up
    a dialog that gives an abbreviated version of the weather observation), but
    most don’t work properly with either page. A
    better solution that supports a wider range of devices is planned.</p>
