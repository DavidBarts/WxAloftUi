    <h1>Welcome to Koosah.INFO</h1>
    <p>Pardon this somewhat bare-bones and utilitarian home page. A nicer one
    is in the works.</p>

    <h2>What’s Here?</h2>

    <h3><a href="/WxAloftUi/obs.jsp?area=KSEA">Real-Time Upper Atmosphere Weather</a></h3>
    <p>This is a map detailing upper-atmosphere weather observations made by
    automated recording equipment aboard commercial aircraft in the
    Seattle area. It’s interactive; hover the mouse pointer over the colored
    dots that represent observations to see the details of that observation.

    <h3><a href="/WxAloftUi/obsm.jsp?area=KSEA">Mobile Device Version</a></h3>
    <p>This page will probably work better on most mobile devices than the
    previous one. If your device supports hovering, the observation details
    should pop up in tool-tip messages. If not, clicking on the dots will bring
    up the observation details in a separate page.</p>
