    <h1>Welcome to Koosah.INFO</h1>
    <p>Pardon this somewhat bare-bones and utilitarian home page. A nicer one
    is in the works.</p>
    
    <h2>Real-Time Upper Atmosphere Weather</h2>
    <p>A map detailing upper-atmosphere weather observations made by
    automated recording equipment aboard commercial aircraft in the
    Seattle area may be found <a href="mm_obs_demo_v2.html">here.</a>
    Mobile device users will probably want to use
    <a href="mm_obs_demo_v3.html">this version</a> instead.</p>
    <p>Both are interactive maps; hover over (or touch) the colored dots that
    represent observations to see the details of each observation.</p>
